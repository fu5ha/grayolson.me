## I am

### an **artist.**
I draw, paint, take photos, make 3d models, videos and visual effects, games, and websites. I love art in all its forms and try to immerse myself in as many as I can, though I usually end up in the visual arts more often than the musical or performant.

### a **programmer.**
Programming was one of my earliest hobbies and it has stuck with me throughought my life. I started in Scratch when I was only in 2nd grade, and now do everything from web development, to blockchain development, to next generation graphics programming for games & generative art in Rust, to binary reverse engineering. 

### a **student.**
I go to school full time, and I am a student in everything I do. I am tremendousy curious and love to learn, enjoying and excelling in subjects as broad as art, computer science, physics, math, and astronomy.
