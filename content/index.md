<section id="about">

### an artist.
I draw, paint, take photos, make 3d models, videos and visual effects, games, and websites. I love art in all its forms and try to immerse myself in as many as I can, though I usually end up in the visual arts more often than the musical or performant.

### a programmer.
Programming has been a primary hobby of mine since I was very young, and has stuck with me throughout my life.
