    ## Symbols and Allusions

    Bengalsky is based on several real world and literary allusions.

    ## Political Educators

    The Soviet Union at the time had what were effectively religious apologists that took an active part in Soviet society, just repurposed to promote the state and Stalin's politics instead of a religion. Bengalsky is a symbol for one of these people. Bulgakov hated them, and so we see that Bengalsky is promptly decapitated and then sent to a mental hospital.

  <section data-markdown="">
    ## Vladimir Ivanovich

    Bengalsky is probably based on Vladimir Ivanovich Nyemirovich-Danchenko (1858-1943), one of the directors of the *Moscow Art Theatre MKhAT*. Bulgakov called him an "old cynic" and he was a so-called *"political educator"* of the day.

  <section data-markdown="">
    ## Metamorphoses

    * Bengalsky's decapitation was probably inspired by a scene from the novel Metamorphoses, also known as The Golden Ass, written by the romanized Berber Lucius Apuleius Platonicus (123 BC- 80 BC).
    * The witch Moreya tears off the head of the main character, Socrates, and puts it back intactly.

    ## The Petty Demon

    - Written by Fyodor Sologub
    - Another of the great Russian novels.
    - Has a character named Bengalsky that plays an important role in the conclusion of the book, a carnivalesque scene much like the one in Master and Margarita.

  ## Book Two Predictions

  I haven't read all of Book Two yet, but:

  * It doesn't seem that he will remain an important character
  * Maybe just wallow out his days in the mental hospital
  * Doesn't seem like many of Stravinsky's patients make it out well again
