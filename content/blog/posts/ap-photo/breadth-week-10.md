title: "AP Photo Week 10: Texture"

This week is texture, and I immediately thought of the iris of the eye.
I want to do macro shots of different peoples' eyes. I don't have a
macro lens, but I can rent one for not very much from Tempe camera,
which I plan on doing on Sunday. I will therefore have photos week one
next week.
