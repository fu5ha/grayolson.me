title: "AP Photo Week 13: Surreal Self Portraits"

I chose to do self portraits for this week, and I want to put in a big
effort and really make some photos that I am happy with this week as I
have not been able to due to how busy I have been the past several weeks
and the short turnaround. I have two ideas, the first being a partially
drawn/painted portrait. The idea is that it would slowly build from a
basic sketch to color then basic shading and polishing until finally
merging into a photo. Here are a few examples that I want to combine
elements from:

![photo2][half-painted]

Second, I want to do a portrait similar to the one below, but each would
be me "holding" one of the primary tools that I use for art, like a
pencil, ink, and paper or something similar.

I will have photos by day 1 the week we come back from break.
