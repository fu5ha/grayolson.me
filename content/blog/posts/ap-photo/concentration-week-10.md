I really like this concept and I think I can really make it work with
the techniques I now have some practice with from this week. So, I'm 
really hoping that there isn't another random roadblock that prevents
me from doing it this week. First time model got sick, last week my
grandpa went to the hospital. So, here's to hoping... Currently planning on shooting
this afternoon or tomorrow morning. I'll have photos by day 2 and turn
in one final photo again.

Now, I thought I should have a backup concept because if this doesn't
work then I don't want to have to scramble quite as hard. So, my backup
plan is to shoot my cousin but doing a very similar concept.
