This week I have had planned for a couple of weeks now. I will be
shooting Marina Sharpe as the Scarlet Witch from Avengers. I will be
trying ot emulate one of the concept art pieces for the movie in which
there is a large amount of vibration in the background while the
character mains sharp and in focus. I'll be shooting at sunset in
downtown Phoenix on Saturday. I'll have photos day 1 and will again be
turning in one final photo.
