For my midterm I have two "plans." Plan A depends on whether or not I
can get my hands on a piece of equipment (computerized telescope mount)
or not. If not then I will be going with Plan B.

Plan A is to take a photo very similar to this one. It will be a
composite of two final images, each one being composed of about 20
sub-exposures of different lengths, mostly 5-minutes.

Plan B is "deserted city" image. The idea behind this is to take enough
photos and composite them so that all the cars, pedestrians, etc. are
removed from what would have otherwise been a busy part of the city.
Here is an example of one.
