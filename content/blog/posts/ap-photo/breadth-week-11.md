title: "AP Photo Week 11: Long Exposure/Motion"
 
---

 

For this week, I will be in Washington, D.C. on a school trip, and I
won't have my normal camera with me. In preparation, I downloaded an app
on my phone that basically does a live version of what StarStax does,
allowing me to take long exposures on it. I don't have specific plans
for what I want to shoot, but hopefully something with the metro is in
the works.
