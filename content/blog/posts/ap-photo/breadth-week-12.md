I knew this assignment was coming up when I went to Washington, D.C. and
so I tried to get some landscape shots there since it is so different
from Arizona. I ended up getting one good one. For my second, I want to
do a cityscape of the area by Tempe Town Lake or a land/cityscape from a
mountain near my house looking over the valley. I'll have photos by Thursday.
