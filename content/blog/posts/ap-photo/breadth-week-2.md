title: "AP Photo Week 2: Natural Light Still Life"
 
---

 

This week our assignment is to take still life photos using natural
light. I think this will be an interesting but challenging assignment
for me because I haven't done very much still life photography in the
past. I didn't really have any epiphanies during the time the
assignment was being described, so I decided to hop on Flickr and google
to find some photos that caught my eye to use as inspiration.

I want to begin shooting on Saturday or Sunday and have at least two of my images
ready to edit by day one.
