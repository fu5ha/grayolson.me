title: "AP Photo Week 3: Portraits Part 1"
 
---

 

Our assignment for the next two weeks is portraits. We will be turning
in three each week. I'm really excited about this assignement as I've
been wanting to do some more advanced portraits for a long time now. My
first idea for this week is probably the most complicated. I want to
combine elements from each of the three photos below.

The first one was where I originally thought of the concept. I already
have a model lined up for this shot and I'm figuring out a location
where I want to shoot it. I want to shoot this on Sunday this week to
have it to start editing day 1. The second idea is a double exposure photo
and I want to have it so that it almost looks like a plant is growing
out of a person or vice-versa as seen in the first example, or something
with the stars like the second one. I don't have a model lined up for
this yet.

Finally, I want to do a low key portrait of my friend in her armor. I
have a few ideas for this, but the primary one is going for the feel of
the first image below but with the angle more similar to the second one.
I will be shooting with her on Saturday to have it ready for editing on
day 1.
