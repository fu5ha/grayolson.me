I want to use this concept but do a different color scheme and
composition. I'm going to have my cousin model for this one, holding a
"spell book" and have floating vials and other implements all around her
and doing things, seemingly by magic. I'll be shooting this either
Sunday night or Monday night. I'll have photos by day 2 and turn in one
final photo.
