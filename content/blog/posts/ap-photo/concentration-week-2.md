For this week I was originally planning to shoot someone else but they
got sick and so couldn't drive down from Tuscon, so I had to improvise.
I decided to try one of my favorite ideas from my concentration ideas
post, the woman "cutting up" her dress with oversized scissors. I'll be
shooting with Ashlyn on Sunday (hopefully) at either the Scottsdale
Civic Center or possibly along Roosevelt Row. I'll be turning in 1 final
photo, either the scissor one or the backup concept below it.
