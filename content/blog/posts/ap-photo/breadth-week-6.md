Our assignment this week is to mix typography and photography. We have
to take two photos and then add text in post to add to the concept of
the photo. I have a couple ideas, "BE BOLD" and "Rise Above Yourself."
Here's a few examples that incorporate different parts of the ideas I
have. I plan to have photos by Day 2 next week.
