title: "Concentration Week 8"

This week I'll be using one of the original plans I had made for the
concentration jump start. I'll be shooting on Saturday around sunset,
have photos by conservatively day 2 only because it's possible that
something will come up because of the way my model's schedule works.
Turn in one final photo.

- Pyramid Head
    - Nim Holmes
    - Desolate landscape
    - sunset or blue hour w/ clouds
    - Contrast with red/orange in front and blue behind or vice
    versa
