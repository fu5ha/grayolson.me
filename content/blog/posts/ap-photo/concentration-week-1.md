I decided to jump right in with a challenging but very rewarding
concept. I'm going to be trying to more or less replicate the example
image, with the effect being the character is plummeting towards the
ground while fighting. I will be shooting on Saturday and Sunday with a
guy named Chris Burton and we will be shooting in the Channel 8 studio
and possibly in a parking garage/warehouse. I'll also be shooting in one
of the high rises down town to get the backplate. I'll have photos in
class by day 1 and plan to have 1 final photo by day 4 next week.
