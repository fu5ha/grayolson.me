This week I'm trying to go back to a less action-y/dark concept but
still stay visually dark, so I'm going to try this example that I found.
A this point I think I'm going to be shooting with a model in the studio and
then compositing it into the background since it will be very hard to
get the correct lighting on location. Currently planning on shooting
Sunday and Monday. I'll have photos by day 2 and turn
in one final photo again.
