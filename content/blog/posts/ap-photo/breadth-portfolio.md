   Trade](https://www.flickr.com/photos/grayolson/23403412631/in/album-72157657526852122/)
  * I chose to include this image in my Breadth portfolio because it
    demonstrates a culmination of much of the knowledge of design and
photography that I have gained so far in my life and because it
demonstrates several of the design principles. It includes
unity/variety, balance, emphasis, and contrast.

  * I wanted to include this piece because it takes elements from not
    just photography but also 2d and 3d design, incorporating the
"low-poly" style, which helps to tell more about me. It includes
unity/variety, emphasis, and contrast.

like how it turned out. In addition, it includes several elements of

    astrophoto I've taken and astrophotography is a fairly large part of
the photography I do. It also includes multiple elements of design:
balance and rhythm.
