title: "AP Photo Week 5: Color"
 
---

 
The assignment for this week is to over emphasize color. We are supposed
to take photos where color is the most prominent element of the photo
and the subject comes second. Here are a few examples I liked that I
would like to try to pull off. I plan to have at least one of these
photos in unedited form by day one and the rest by day two and three
respectively.
