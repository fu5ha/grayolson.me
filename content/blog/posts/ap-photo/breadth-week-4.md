Continuing from last week, I have a few more requirements I need to
fill. The first is that I still need to do texture since I ended up not
doing it last week. I also want to knock out the multiple people one in
the same image by doing something very similar to this image that I also
used as an example last week. I hope to shoot this in the studio next
week after school on Tuesday or Wednesday and I already have people in
mind but not confirmed.

Next, I am going to be shooting my friend in her Power Girl costume on
Saturday. This will fill the figure-ground relationship outdoors
requirement. Here's a few ideas I have for poses but I'm not sure what
will end up working best.

Finally, I want to take a dramatic sports portrait. I am going to be
asking two potential candidates today and I hope to shoot them either in
the studio at Channel 8 over the weekend or at school on Tuesday or
Wednesday.
