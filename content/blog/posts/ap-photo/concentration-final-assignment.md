This is the result of several months of work on one subject. I chose the
subject of my concentration back January and then spent four months working
on improving myself and my photos under its umbrella. My concentration is outlined
as follows:

My concentration is surreal portraiture focused on creating a
fantastical environment that accentuates the abilities and mood of the
character depicted. The photos are tied together using heavy
compositing, a complementary color scheme, cinematic color grading, and
deep space to create figure/ground relationship and a sense of drama and
fantasy.

This is the description submitted as part of my submission to the college board/AP:

1 has blue and orange color tones from the sunset and shows
figure/ground relationship. 2 has yellow and blue as well as green and
red color tones and uses composite editing to bring life to the
character. 3 has blue and orange color tones and the background/pose
bring depth and connect the character to the scene. 4 uses a high
contrast cinematic grade and 3d compositing to tell the story behind the
character. 5 has another high contrast cinematic grade that brings some
blues into the shadows to complement the oranges and uses composited
props to tell the character's story. 6 uses an expansive background to
create figure/ground relationship, has high contrast, and has blue and
orange color tones. 7 uses a CG background to create depth and
figure/ground relationship that would otherwise be impossible. 8
continues that trend and also ties in composited lightning as well as
high contrast. 9 again uses dominant blue with orange and high contrast
with a CG background and CG prop in the dragon. 10 highlights the
complimentary colors by making that contrast part of the focal point. 11
uses matte painting techniques to combine several photos into a new
background as well as the dominant blue colors and CG lightning. 12 uses
desaturated blues and saturated pinks as well as high local contrast on
the subject to draw viewers' interest.
