This week is going to be a bit hard for me because I didn't already have
a model nailed down, but I want to do the concept shown below. I'm
planning on shooting Sunday with a model on location and then editing in
class during the week. I'm planning on shooting with a woman named Tori
currently but that might change. I have a couple of backup concepts
planned in my head as well. I will have photos by Day 1 and turn in one
final photo.
