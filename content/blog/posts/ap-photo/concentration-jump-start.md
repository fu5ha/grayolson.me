1. Fantasy portraits with surreal editing tied together with vivid colors,
   high dynamic range, and a complimentary/split complementary color palette.
2. Visual Questions
  - How can you create a believable fantasy environment and atmosphere from real world
    locations?
  - How can you emphasize both a person as a subject as well as
    the environment they are in and the costume they are wearing?
  - How can you use composition and lighting to create movement in a
    frame?
3. I have [this blog post](http://grayolson.com/ap/photography/2015/12/13/ap-photo-concentration-references.html) where I have kept a collection of images to use
   as reference and that exemplify the style that I am aiming for.
4. Plan for images
    - Drifter
        - Chris Burton
        - Falling from building while shooting upwards, shot looking down.
    Composite of two images; shot in studio at channel 8 for one, in
    high rise downtown for other.
        - Red/red orange contrast with yellow green/blue green

    - Scarlet Witch
        - Marina Sharpe
        - Two possible ideas, in both cases doing a "power pose" with
        magic effects in hands/eyes
        - Incorporate red/red orange contrast with blue
        - I like concept 2 more overall
        - Warehouse district downtown

    - Pyramid Head
        - Nim Holmes
        - Desolate landscape
        - Possibly sunset or blue hour w/ clouds
        - Contrast with red/orange in front and blue behind or vice
        versa
        - Possibly get background actors to stand in as zombies
