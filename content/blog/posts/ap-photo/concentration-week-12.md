For this week I'm going to be combining my photo shoot with a video
shoot. I'm going to be shooting this girl Echo who is goign to be
playing a character from HxH that is able to create lightning around
himself/between his limbs. I dont have a specific reference photo, but I
have thought about what I want to do quite extensively since I'm also
going to be using it as part of a video shoot. It'll be along the same
lines of my recent ones: wide/large landscape, overall dark/blue
composition with lit model and effects in the center of the frame. I'm
going to be shooting on Monday during break. I also might do another
photo at some point during break of a character called Fetch Walker, but
don't have a specific reference for that one either.
