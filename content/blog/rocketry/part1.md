These are a couple ideas I had for the rocketry assignment I am doing in my intro to engineering class. The objective is to make a rocket that flies as close to 300ft as possible and lands in as close to 30 seconds as possible.

### Small & light - Primary:

1.  Cardboard tube
2.  Balsa fins
3.  Aerodynamic nose cone
4.  Altimeter snug fit with its own recovery device - streamer or parachute

### Heavy & innovative - fun idea: Multi-rotor recovery

1.  3d printed tube
2.  3d printed nose cone, aerodynamic with modification
3.  3d printed fins
4.  Altimeter in nose cone

I had the idea to have some sort of small model helicopter or multirotor that would I would be able to control to make the landing exactly at 30 seconds. I don't know how practical this would be though. I was thinking there are those small quad- or hex-rotors that I may be able to mount inside the rocket or nose cone somehow and attach the altimeter to it, then have it deploy properly at max height. I'll have to explore this idea further to see about the practicality of it.
